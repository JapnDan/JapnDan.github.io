            <p>You know what. I've been thinking that giraffes really aren't that different from you and I because if you
            think about it, we each have our own baggage that makes us beat our wives. Sometimes we even beat them on the
            ass because they run in your room drunk in their tighty-whities. In conclusion don't fuckin interrupt when

            <p>HA you thought I'd say shit bout google. Once I put some googly eyes on a turd I had recently taken.
            I took a photo of the now googly-looking beauty and uploaded it to several media sites. The feedback was
            astounding. 8/10 Couldn't ask for a better rating for a last minute turd polish.</p>
